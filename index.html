        <h1>What's this</h1>
        <p>This is a “cover app”.</p>
        <p>I am aware that you have hundreds of cover letters to go through for the position of Desktop Software
            Engineer.</p>
        <p>How about a desktop app that does same thing as cover letter?</p>

        <h1>Who made this</h1>
        <p>I am Ishan Sharma, a Full Stack Engineer. I saw your job post for
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/868934275/" target="_blank">Desktop Developer</a>
            on LinkedIn and decided to apply. </p>
        <p>Right now, I am a graduate CS student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I graduate in May 2019 and
            I’d love to work at Signal after that. </p>

    <div id="consider" class="step slide" data-x="2000" data-y="-1500" data-autoplay="10">
        <h1>Why should Signal consider me?</h1>
        <p>Signal cares about privacy. And I’m a Software Engineer with a passion for privacy.</p>
        <p>I don’t just talk about it. I avoid Google products, except Gmail for an old address and I no longer
            have a FaceBook account. One of my top priorities in a workplace is respect for user privacy and Signal is
            one of the few such workplaces. </p>
