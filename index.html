        <p class="message out">I am Ishan Sharma, a Full Stack Engineer. I saw your job post for
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/868934275/" target="_blank">Desktop Developer</a>
            on LinkedIn and decided to apply. <br/>
            Right now, I am a graduate CS student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I graduate in May 2019 and
            I‚Äôd love to work at Signal after that.</p>

        <p class="message in">Why should Signal consider you?</p>
        <p class="message out">Signal cares about privacy. And I‚Äôm a Software Engineer with a passion for privacy.<br/>
            I don‚Äôt just talk about it. I avoid Google products (except Gmail for an old address) and I no longer
            have a FaceBook account. One of my top priorities in a workplace is respect for user privacy and Signal is
            one of the few companies that align so closely with my values.</p>
